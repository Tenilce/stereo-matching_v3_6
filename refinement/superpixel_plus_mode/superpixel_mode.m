% Segmentation (by Super Pixel) Plus Mode Area Algorithm

 % INPUT
 %   I the Reference Image
 %   D initial disparity map
 %   k - Number of desired superpixels. Note that this is nominal
 %       the actual number of superpixels generated will generally
 %       be a bit larger, espiecially if parameter m is small.
 %   m - Weighting factor between colour and spatial
 %       differences. Values from about 5 to 40 are useful.  Use a
 %       large value to enforce superpixels with more regular and
 %       smoother shapes. Try a value of 10 to start with.
 %   seRadius - Regions morphologically smaller than this are merged with
 %              adjacent regions. Try a value of 1 or 1.5.  Use 0 to
 %              disable.
 %   colopt - String 'mean' or 'median' indicating how the cluster
 %            colour centre should be computed. Defaults to 'mean'
 %   mw - Optional median filtering window size.  Image compression
 %        can result in noticeable artifacts in the a*b* components
 %        of the image.  Median filtering can reduce this. mw can be
 %        a single value in which case the same median filtering is
 %        applied to each L* a* and b* components.  Alternatively it
 %        can be a 2-vector where mw(1) specifies the median
 %        filtering window to be applied to L* and mw(2) is the
 %        median filtering window to be applied to a* and b*.
